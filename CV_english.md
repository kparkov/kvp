---

Full-stack / backend developer with focus on software architecture and with leader experience. Started my career with focus on web, and have since moved towards more complicated software systems within public administration, research and finance. I have clear strengths on the backend side of development, but I still have a lot of experience implementing a web interface in the form of a REST API and a React frontend.

In 2013 I started my own company ([Bitkompagniet](http://bitkompagniet.dk) - Danish only), and have done a number of projects both as a supplier and an on-site consultant. My role has varied greatly - some projects I have done alone, in others I have been a team member or technical lead.

I am focused on process and project models, and I am a fan of test driven development, code reviews and a reasonable git flow.

I live in Copenhagen with my girlfriend Ida and our daughter Liva.

**Software architect / developer / co-owner**  
Aug 2015 - Jun 2016

The idea behind Launch was to make public procurement easier for the public sector, by offering tools to manage and control the process and dialogue with potential suppliers, while also integrating with the Danish portal for procurements and EU's TED systems. I was a part of the group who developed the idea and the product from the bottom. The idea was good and found a lot of support, but the group lacked experience in executing an ambitious product development process. We ran out of resources, and the project became my failed startup.
