---

Full-stack / backend developer with focus on software architecture and with leader experience. Started my career with focus on web, and have since moved towards more complicated software systems within medicine, research and administration. I have clear strengths on the backend side of development, but I still have a lot of experience implementing a web interface in the form of a REST API and a React frontend.

In 2013 I started my own company ([Bitkompagniet](http://bitkompagniet.dk) - Danish only), and have done a number of projects both as a supplier and an on-site consultant. My role has varied greatly - some projects I have done alone, in others I have been a team member or technical lead.

I am focused on process and project models, and I am a fan of test driven development, code reviews and a reasonable git flow.

I live in Copenhagen with my girlfriend Ida and our daughter Liva.
