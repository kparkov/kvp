#### Alternative formats

If you need to print or copy/paste the contents into a template, I offer these alternative options. However, please note that they are auto-generated from the raw format, which means the formatting is correct, but it may have some layout issues.

- PDF (best for print): [Danish](CV_danish.pdf) / [English](CV_english.pdf)
- Word (best for copy/paste into Word templates): [Danish](CV_danish.docx) / [English](CV_english.docx)
